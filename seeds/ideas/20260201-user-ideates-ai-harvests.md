## The Idea

Invert the documentation burden: user thinks freely, AI silently captures.

## Context

While building a content seed capture system, user realized that manual capture commands (`seed-idea`, `seed-prompt`) still require context-switching. The insight: AI should be a passive harvester, not a tool to invoke.

## Raw Quote

> "seed idea capture and naming should be automated. I am just doing ideation and feedback on agent work and you harvest all"

## Expansion Potential

This pattern applies beyond content seeds:
- Meeting notes (human talks, AI summarizes)
- Code documentation (human codes, AI documents)
- Decision logs (human decides, AI records rationale)
- Learning journals (human works, AI extracts lessons)

The shift: from "user documents with AI help" to "AI documents while user works"

## Content Angle

- Philosophy piece: "The Passive AI Collaborator"
- Tutorial: "Building auto-capture systems with LLMs"
- Case study: "How I stopped taking notes and let AI do it"
