## The Idea

One vault to rule them all - consolidate all knowledge artifacts into a single Obsidian hub.

## Context

While building a content seed capture system, initially created a separate `.content-seeds/` directory. User redirected: "BrainFucked will be hub for every idea, content, post."

The insight: don't fragment knowledge across multiple locations. One searchable, linkable graph.

## Why It Matters

Fragmentation kills knowledge work:
- Seeds in one place, drafts in another, posts elsewhere
- No cross-linking between related content
- Multiple search locations
- Sync/backup complexity

Single hub enables:
- Obsidian graph shows connections
- One search to find anything
- Wikilinks across all content types
- Simpler backup (one folder)

## Expansion Potential

- The case for monorepo-style knowledge management
- How Obsidian's linking creates emergent structure
- "Folder taxonomy" vs "tag + link" organization
