## The Idea

The process of creating content can itself be content.

## Expanded

When working with AI assistants, the conversation itself - the prompts, the iterations, the decisions made - forms a narrative that others can learn from. Instead of just publishing the "finished product," document the entire creation process.

This applies to:
- Building systems with AI help (this very system was built this way)
- Debugging sessions that reveal thought patterns
- Design decisions made through dialogue
- The evolution of ideas through iteration

## Why It Matters

1. **Authenticity**: Shows real work, not polished facades
2. **Educational**: Others learn from the process, not just the result
3. **Efficiency**: No separate "documentation" step - work IS documentation
4. **Content multiplication**: One work session = multiple content pieces

## This Session as Example

This very conversation demonstrates the concept:
- User wanted a system to capture prompts/ideas/misses
- The conversation itself is content about building that system
- Meta-recursion: we're documenting the documentation system

## Content Angle

Multiple posts possible:
1. **Tutorial**: "How to turn AI sessions into blog content"
2. **Philosophy**: "Work as documentation, documentation as work"
3. **Case study**: "Building a content capture system with AI"
4. **Meta**: "This post was written while building the system it describes"
