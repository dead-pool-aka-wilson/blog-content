## The Idea

Source real memes from Twitter/TikTok, adapt with AI for blog posts - not generate from scratch.

## Context

When adding visual content to the blog system, user specifically wanted:
1. Real viral memes (authenticity > AI-generated)
2. Light adaptation via Gemini (text overlays, context shifts)
3. Reuse tracking (which posts used which memes)

Key insight: adapted memes > generated images because the meme format IS the communication.

## Raw Quote

> "not just using gemini to create new image but use memes that are popular in twitter or tiktok and use it for my post with little changes with gemini"

## Expansion Potential

- Curation as creation
- The semiotics of meme adaptation
- Why AI-generated images feel "off" for humor

## Content Angle

- Tutorial: "Meme-driven blog content pipeline"
- Opinion: "Why I source memes instead of generating them"
