## The Prompt

> in dev folder of koed I want to gather prompts I wrote, Idea I had, misses we made and write blog contents with those. for example let's say i am creating blog with you right now, and I want this to be an content at the same time.

## What Made It Work

1. **Clear categories**: prompts, ideas, misses - three distinct types
2. **Meta-awareness**: explicitly stated the conversation itself should be content
3. **Location specified**: "dev folder" gave concrete starting point
4. **Open enough**: didn't over-specify, allowed for design discussion

## The Response Quality

Good - AI:
- Proposed directory structure before implementing
- Asked for confirmation
- Discovered existing blog skills and built on them
- Created templates + real first example
- Documented the system while building it (meta-content)

## Content Angle

This prompt/response pair demonstrates:
- How to scope a system design request
- Effective prompt structure for creative technical work
- The value of vague → specific iteration

Could become: "Anatomy of a good system design prompt"
