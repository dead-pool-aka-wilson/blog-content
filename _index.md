This blog is named after [Raoul Coutard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoul_Coutard)—the cinematographer who defined the Nouvelle Vague look. *À bout de souffle*. *Le Mépris*. *Pierrot le Fou*. Handheld cameras on the streets of Paris. Natural light. No permits. No studio system.

Godard and Truffaut broke every rule of classical cinema. We're doing the same with content.

The director calls the shots. The AI crew executes. What you see is raw footage—jump cuts included. No screenplay. No second takes. Just the work as it happens.

Code. Cinema. Canvas. Philosophy. Whatever's in frame.

**Records don't edit.**
